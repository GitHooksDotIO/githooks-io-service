# Contest
GitHooks.io needs your help to create some awesome GitHooks people can start installing to their repositories.

We're giving away a Â£25 Amazon Gift Voucher to the best GitHook submitted to GitHooks.io by **31st December**!

![Amazon gift card](https://www.highstreetvouchers.com/COMMON/hsv/large/amazon-gift-cards-certificates-1.jpg)

Stuck for ideas? Check out the [GitHook ideas](http://githooks.io/githook-ideas) list.

## Rules

* Must be a valid GitHook, submitted to GitHooks.io
* Must come up to a certain standard, i.e. be at least vaguely useful or fun.
* You agree to keep the repository open for at least a few months
* You agree that GitHooks.io can make a copy of the repository under our Organisation account (we will credit you)
* Basically, we don't want the GitHook to disappear once we've sent you the prize. That's fair enough, right?
