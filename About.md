# About GitHooks.io
_GitHooks.io is a platform for easily developing, hosting and consuming GitHub webhooks._

GitHub's [webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/) feature allows you to notify any arbitrary service when something of interest happens to your repository or organisation. The possibilities this affords you are endless and exciting, so much so that we've decided to set up GitHooks.io; a platform enabling easy development, consumption and execution of webhooks.

Webhooks can automate your workflows, run your tests, perform checks on your code, and so on. But they're often bespoke, in-house solutions; written, maintained and hosted internally. A GitHook is a webhook which conforms to a certain API, and is therefore able to be executed on GitHooks.io, saving you the hassle and expense of hosting your own webhook receiver, and also providing a platform for developers to share their webhooks with the world.
